# nilsding-ebuilds

This is a [Layman](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml) overlay of some ebuilds I wrote/modified.

## How To Install This Fine Overlayâ„¢

As root, do this:
```
layman -L -o https://raw.github.com/nilsding/nilsding-ebuilds/master/nilsding-ebuilds.xml -a nilsding-ebuilds
```
That should work.
